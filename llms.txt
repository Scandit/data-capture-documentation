## Symbology-properties

- [Symbology Properties | Scandit Developer Documentation](https://docs.scandit.com/symbology-properties/): Symbologies often have different properties, such as symbol count (length of the barcode) or inverted colors (printed white on black). To provide optimal performances, some properties/values are disabled by default in our SDK. You might need to scan a symbology whose properties are by default disabled. This article lists all symbology specific properties, their defaults and possible values.
