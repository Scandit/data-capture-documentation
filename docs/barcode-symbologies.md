## Additional Symbologies

### GS1 Data Carrier

The GS1 organization defined a [standard](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes-epcrfid-id-keys/gs1-general-specifications&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1724244897545334&usg=AOvVaw10tvH29tXazbZZd0PTU1uR) to encode application specific data in a barcode. The symbologies Code128, GS1 DataBar, DataMatrix and QR codes can contain GS1 encoded data.

The barcode property `SDCBarcode.isGS1DataCarrier` tells you if a barcode contains GS1 encoded data. GS1 data has to be accessed using `SDCBarcode.rawData` and not `SDCBarcode.data` because it is stored in machine readable form and might contain non-printable characters such as group separators (ASCII 29).

GS1 encoded data cannot be displayed directly to the user. The application identifiers cannot be distinguished from the data and non-printable characters might be part of the data. There are three different options to process the data. Use the Scandit parser API to convert the machine readable data into a human readable string, use the Scandit parser to extract all data elements (Application Identifiers) from the machine readable data or lastly use your own parser to transform the machine readable data.

Example of a correctly encoded GS1 Code128 (also known as GS1-128) barcode:

![GS1 Code128](/img/symbologies/gs1_code128.png)

The machine readable data that gets scanned from the code above, where \<GS\> represents the non-printable group separator character:

```text
1088748816455721123456789012<GS>11111228
```

The same data in the human readable representation:

```text
(10)887488164557(21)123456789012(11)111228
```

The same data parsed into its application identifiers by the Scandit parser:

```json
[
    {
        "name" : "01",
        "parsed" : {
            "indicator" : 1,
            "company_prefix" : "0887488",
            "item_reference" : "16455"
        },
        "rawString" : "10887488164557"
    },
    {
        "name" : "21",
        "parsed" : "123456789012",
        "rawString" : "123456789012"
    },
    {
        "name" : "11",
        "parsed" : {
            "year" : 2011,
            "month" : 12,
            "day" : 28
        },
        "rawString" : "111228"
    }
]
```

## Symbology Specific Notes

* **Code128** uses a leading FNC1 character (ASCII 21) to signal GS1 data. The FNC1 character is encoded but will not be returned in the barcode result.
* **GS1 DataBar** always contains GS1 data.
* **DataMatrix** and **QR Code** use an internal symbology specific FNC1 symbol to signal GS1 data carrier mode. The internal symbol is not returned as part of the result. The common mistake of adding a leading group separator character in raw byte mode does not turn the code into a GS1 data carrier.

There are many incorrectly encoded GS1 codes in the wild. The following image depicts two common error cases: The first incorrect code uses a leading group separator instead of the DataMatrix specific encoding scheme. The second error case encodes the human readable GS1 data representation in a normal DataMatrix code.
