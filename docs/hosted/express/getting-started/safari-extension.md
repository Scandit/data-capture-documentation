# Safari Browser Extension

The **Safari Browser Extension** is an alternative to the Scandit Express Keyboard. It allows barcode data to be scanned and injected directly into web applications running inside Safari on iOS devices.

Instead of typing from the Express Keyboard, users can trigger the scanner via a button next to text fields in a webpage. This is especially useful for workflows where scanning should be initiated directly from the application interface.

## Installation

The Safari Browser Extension is bundled with the **Scandit Express** app as an extension (`.appex`).  

- When the Scandit Express app is installed, the Safari extension is also installed but must be enabled by the user.  

By default, Safari will ask for permission to run the extension on websites and users can choose:
- **Allow Once**
- **Always Allow**
- **Deny**

Once enabled, the extension is visible in the Safari toolbar.

Both the extension icon and the pop-up UI can be customized.

## How It Works

When enabled, the extension automatically adds a **Scan** button next to input fields in Safari webpages.

1. The user taps the **Scan** button next to a text field.  
2. Safari opens a deep link to the Scandit Express app.  
3. The Express scanner is launched, and the scanned barcode is stored in shared storage.  
4. Safari is brought back into focus.  
5. The extension retrieves the scan result and inserts it into the selected input field.  

## Configuration

### Default Behavior

By default, the extension attaches a scan button next to every `<input type="text">` field on the page.

### Restricting Buttons to Specific Fields

Developers can limit the scan button to appear only for specific fields by providing CSS selectors.

```json
{
  "browserExtension": {
    "selectors": [".class", "#id"]
  }
}
