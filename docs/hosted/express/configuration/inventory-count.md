# Inventory Count

Scandit Express an **Inventory Count** mode designed for fast,
robust, and flexible item counting. This mode leverages **MatrixScan Count** and **SparkScan** to support real-world inventory, stock management, and audit scenarios.

It can be launched directly from the home screen of Scandit Express.

**Inventory Count** provides:

- **Two scanning modes**: **MatrixScan Count** for batch scanning with progress tracking, and **SparkScan** for fast single-item scanning.
- **Persistent scanned item list**: The scanned list remains available across sessions and workflows until explicitly cleared.
- **List-based workflows**: Validate scanned items against a preloaded list of up to 120 barcodes.
- **Flexible list loading**: Load lists via deep-link URLs or QR codes, including support for multiple QR codes for large lists.
- **Duplicate handling**: Configure whether duplicates are allowed or restricted.
- **Export to CSV**: Export results with full customization options.
- **Status overlays**: Mark items as `Expired`, `Close to Expire`, or `Not Found`.
- **Progress bar**: Shows scanning progress when working against a list.

## Getting Started

On start, you will have two options: 

* **Count without List** which will allow you to start scanning products and then export a list of them.
* **Load Order List** which allows you to load a predefined list of barcodes and then scan products to see if they are on the list. Lists can be loaded:
    - From a **deep-link URL** (e.g. `https://express.scandit.com/count/list?listName=myList&data=123,456,789`)
    - From a **QR code** encoding the same URL
    - From **multiple QR codes** (for very large lists)

### Scanning Modes

There are two scanning modes available in Inventory Count, toggleable in the UI:

- **MatrixScan Count**: Batch scanning with progress tracking.
- **SparkScan**: Fast, single-item scanning.

The scanned item list is **persistent across sessions and workflows**.
Switching between modes or leaving the app does not clear it.
