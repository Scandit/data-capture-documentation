# Custom Data Transfer

The **Custom Data Transfer** feature in Scandit Express lets you import and export data using a configurable CSV file or Google Sheet. By aligning data formats between Scandit Express and your system, this feature ensures seamless integration into your workflow without the need for coding or reformatting.

## Key Benefits

Traditionally, data captured with Scandit Express could only be exported:

- Automatically into a text field (via virtual keyboard).
- To certain Android apps using a special sharing method.
- Through standardized CSV reports.

Standardized reports often use fixed field names that may not match your system’s database structure. This required manual reformatting before the data could be consolidated, slowing down workflows and creating friction.

**Custom Data Transfer eliminates this step** by letting you configure both input and output formats to match your system’s data structure.

- **No reformatting required**: Align captured data directly with your system’s fields.
- **Flexible import and export**: Use Google Sheets, CSV files, or manual lists created in Scandit Express.
- **Improved efficiency**: Reduce time spent on post-processing, so employees can focus on scanning tasks.
- **System-agnostic**: Works with any system, including legacy systems, without the need for integration or custom development.

## How It Works

1. **Configure field mappings**;  
   - Define which data fields are relevant for your capture flow.  
   - Match these fields to the structure of your system’s database.  
2. **Import data** into Scandit Express.  
   - Upload a CSV file.  
   - Connect to a Google Sheet.  
   - Or create a new list directly within the app.  
3. **Capture and update data** using Scandit Express.  
4. **Export data** in your configured format, ready to be consumed by your system without additional formatting.

## Example Workflow

- A product list is exported from your system in CSV format.  
- The CSV is imported into Scandit Express using the Custom Data Transfer feature.  
- Employees capture or update data during scanning tasks.  
- The updated data is exported back to CSV or Google Sheets in the same format—ready to be re-imported into your system without adjustments.
