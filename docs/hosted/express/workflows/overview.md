# Built-in Workflows

Scandit Express’s built-in workflows are configurable, ready-to-deploy modes designed to accomplish a specific task. They provide actionable insights to the user through prompts or AR-guidance.

There are four built-in workflows available in Scandit Express:

## Task Management

Task Management is a workflow designed to help users efficiently manage tasks related to product recalls. It provides a streamlined process for capturing and acting on important product information.

The user enters the recalled lot number(s) into Scandit Express. They then scan the item's barcode, lot number, and (optionally) the expiry date. Scandit Express analyzes the data and displays an on-screen prompt with the appropriate next steps.

## Markdown

The Markdown workflow in Scandit Express is designed to streamline the process of marking down fresh items approaching their expiry dates.

This workflow allows users to quickly and accurately capture the necessary information, reducing the time spent on manual checks.

No integration is required — the markdown logic can be configured directly in the Scandit Express dashboard. Once set up, users hover the camera over an item’s barcode and expiry date and Scandit Express captures and interprets the data based on the configured logic. An AR overlay is then displayed, guiding the user on the appropriate action to take.

## Track and Trace

Track and Trace is a workflow designed to enhance the visibility and management of pharmaceutical products throughout the supply chain.

This workflow allows users to complete two workflows at once by verifying drug expiration with AR overlays while receiving or taking stock. Expired items are highlighted with a distinctive AR overlay and enable users to take immediate action. 

:::warning
This workflow only works for items which have the expiry date encoded in the barcode.

## Age Check

Scandit Express's Age Check workflow allows users to verify age and ID authenticity.

This helps ensure compliance with age-restricted regulations, such as alcohol sales or vehicle rentals, using Scandit's powerful ID Scanning and Validation technology.

Users can scan the front and/or back of IDs, and they receive immediate feedback including verification of authenticity, expiry, and age. All scanned IDs can be exported at the end if needed.
