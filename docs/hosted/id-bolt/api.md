## ID Bolt Session

The main class of ID Bolt is `IdBoltSession`. It represents a session in which the end-user is guided through a workflow to scan their ID. The `IdBoltSession.onCompletion()` callback is called when the user has scanned their ID, the ID has been accepted and the ID Bolt pop-up is closed. Similarly, `IdBoltSession.onCancellation()` is called when the user closes the ID Bolt pop-up without finishing the full process successfully.

Using validators, ID Bolt can verify the expiration date or other features of the ID. Optionally, this can be done without sharing any personally identifiable information (PII) with your website.

### Methods

#### `create`

| Signature | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `static create(serviceUrl: string, options: IdBoltCreateSessionOptions): IdBoltSession` | Primary way to create an ID Bolt session. |

##### Parameters

- `serviceUrl: string`: URL that ID Bolt loads when started. Provided in your account on the [Scandit dashboard](https://ssl.scandit.com/dashboard).

:::note
The default value `app.id-scanning.com` is an alias that points to Scandit’s servers. In a production environment it can be changed to your own domain name pointing to Scandit’s servers. This will require you to configure a CNAME record in the DNS settings of your domain. Contact your Scandit account manager for more information.
:::

- `options: IdBoltCreateSessionOptions`: Object specifying the session options:
  - `licenseKey: string`: Your license key, provided in you account on the [Scandit dashboard](https://ssl.scandit.com/dashboard).
  - `documentSelection: Document Selection`: Object specifying the acceptable documents. See *[`Document Selection`](#document-selection)*.
  - `returnDataMode: ReturnDataMode`: Defines the extent of the data returned by the `onCompletion()` callback. Use:    
    - `ReturnDataMode.FullWithImages` to get all extracted data and images.
    - `ReturnDataMode.Full` to get all extracted data without images.
  - `anonymizationMode?: AnonymizationMode`: Define the extend returned data is anonymized. See *[`Anonymization Mode`](#anonymization-mode)*.
  - `scanner?: Scanner`: Options to customize the scanner. See *[`Scanner`](#scanner-options)*.
  - `validation?: Validators[]`: Optional array of validators, default: `[]`. See *[`Validators`](#validators)*. 
  - `locale?: string`: The language in which the text is displayed. Default: `"en-US"`.
  - `workflow?: WorkflowOptions`: Options to customize the workflow. See *[`Workflow Options`](#workflow-options)*.
  - `theme?: Theme`: Options to customize the theme. See *[`Theme`](#theme)*.
  - `textOverrides?: TextOverrides`: Options to customize the text. See *[`Text Overrides`](#text-overrides)*.
  - `onCompletion: (result: CompletionResult) => void`: A callback that is called when the user has successfully scanned their ID.
  - `onCancellation?: (reason: CancellationReason) => void`: A callback that is called whenever the flow can not be completed.


Once created, a session object does nothing until you execute `start()` on it:

```ts
const idBoltSession = IdBoltSession.create(ID_BOLT_URL, {
	licenseKey: LICENSE_KEY,
	documentSelection,
	returnDataMode: ReturnDataMode.FullWithImages,
	validation: [Validators.notExpired()],
	onCompletion: (result) => {
		alert("Successfully completed workflow");
	},
	onCancellation: (reason) => {
		switch (reason) {
			case CancellationReason.UserClosed:
				console.log("User closed the scanning window");
				break;
			case CancellationReason.ServiceStartFailure:
				console.log("ID Bolt service failed to start");
				break;
		}
	}
});
await idBoltSession.start();
```

#### `start`

| Signature | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `async IdBoltSession.start(): Promise<string>` | Open the ID Bolt pop-up to start the scanning workflow. This method returns a session ID identifying the session. |

## Document Selection

Documents are selected using the `DocumentSelection` class.

A class to define which types of documents the ID Bolt will accept. The list of documents is provided as specific document objects, instantiated with a `Region`. For example passports from the USA would be `new Passport(Region.USA)`.

Documents that are not acceptable may still get recognized by the scanner. In this case the user will be notified to use one of the accepted document types.

#### `create`

| Signature | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `static DocumentSelection.create(selection: Selection): DocumentSelection` | Primary way to create a `DocumentSelection` instance with all the included and excluded documents. Only `Selection.include` is mandatory. |

```ts
const documentSelection = DocumentSelection.create({
	accepted: [
		new Passport(Region.Any),
		// You can either use country name or ISO code
		new IDCard(Region.FRA),
		new DriverLicense(Region.France)
	],
	rejected: [
		// You can explicitly reject certain documents, if they would be included otherwise.
		new Passport(Region.Switzerland)
	],
});
```

### Document Types

Document types are represented by classes. The general purpose document classes can all be instantiated with a specific region. 

These document type instances are used to define which documents are accepted or rejected in the `DocumentSelection` class.

#### Passport

Includes all Passports

```ts
new Passport(Region.USA) // US passports
new Passport(Region.Any) // Any passport
```

#### ID Card

Includes national identity cards

```ts
new IDCard(Region.Germany) // German identity cards
new IDCard(Region.Any) // National identity card from any country
```

#### Driver License

Includes driver licenses

```ts
new DriverLicense(Region.France) // French driver license
new DriverLicense(Region.Any) // Driver license card from any country
```

#### Visa (ICAO)

Includes visas that comply with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards

```ts
new VisaIcao(Region.USA) // US ICAO-compliant visas
new VisaIcao(Region.Any) // Any ICAO-compliant visa
```


#### Residence Permit

Includes residence permits

```ts
new ResidencePermit(Region.USA) // US residence permits
new ResidencePermit(Region.Any) // Residence permit from any country
```

#### Health Insurance Card

Includes health insurance cards

```ts
new HealthInsuranceCard(Region.Germany) // German health insurance cards
new HealthInsuranceCard(Region.Any) // Health insurance card from any country
```

#### Region Specific Documents

In addition to the general purpose document classes, there are also region specific document. These documents are instantiated with the `RegionSpecific` class and a `RegionSpecificSubtype` argument.

Example:
```ts
new RegionSpecific(RegionSpecificSubtype.BelgiumMinorsId) // Belgian minors ID
new RegionSpecific(RegionSpecificSubtype.MexicoTaxId) // Mexican tax ID
```

The list of supported region specific document types can be found [here](#supported-region-specific-documents).



### Regions

Regions are used to define the region of a document. They can be used to define which documents are accepted or rejected in the `DocumentSelection` class.

Regions can be chosen using the `Region` enum. The `Region` enum contains both the ISO code and the name of the region.
If your system uses three-letter ISO codes, you can also directly use those strings.

Example:

```ts
// France
Region.FRA;
Region.France;

Region.FRA === Region.France === "FRA"; // true

// Any
Region.Any;
```


#### Two-letter ISO code

If you have a two-letter ISO code, you can convert it to a region using the `Region.fromShortCode` method. To convert a region to a two-letter ISO code, use the `Region.toShortCode` method.

Example:

```ts
const region = Region.fromShortCode("FR"); // == Region.France == "FRA"
const shortCode = Region.toShortCode(Region.FRA); // == "FR"
```

In case the provided short code is not valid, the methods throw an exception.



## Validators

Validators enable you to run checks on the scanned ID. They are only run on documents that are from the list of accepted documents.

The avaliablde validators can be created by using the `Validators` class.

The following validators are available:

#### Not Expired

The `notExpired` validator checks that the scanned document has not expired. This validator will not pass if the expiration date could not be determined from the extracted data.

```ts
	...
	validation: [Validators.notExpired()],
	...
```



#### Not Expired In

The `notExpiredIn` validator checks that the scanned document has still not expired after the duration passed in argument. This test will not pass if the expiration date could not be determined from the extracted data.

This validator takes a `Duration` object as argument with the following properties: 

```ts
type Duration = {
	days?: number;
	months?: number;
}
```

In the following example, the ID must not expire in the next 12 months:

```ts
	...
	validation: [Validators.notExpiredIn({months: 12})],
	...
```

#### US Real ID

The `US.isRealID` validator checks that the scanned driver license is compliant with the rules of Real ID defined by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA). This validator will not pass if the scanned document is not an AAMVA document.

```ts
	...
	validation: [Validators.US.isRealID()],
	...
```

## Callbacks

### Methods

#### `onCompletion`

A callback that is called when the user has successfully scanned their ID and passed all validations.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `result` | `CompletionResult` | Contains the scanning results including the captured ID data |

The `CompletionResult` object contains:
- `capturedId`: The scanned document data. See *[`CapturedId`](#capturedid)*. Will be `null` if no data was returned based on the `returnDataMode`.

Example:
```ts
	...
	onCompletion: (result) => {
		if (result.capturedId) {
			console.log('Document type:', result.capturedId.documentType);
			console.log('Full name:', result.capturedId.fullName);
			console.log('Document number:', result.capturedId.documentNumber);
		}
	}
	...

The `CancellationReason` enum contains:
- `CancellationReason.UserClosed`: The user closed the ID Bolt pop-up before completing the scanning process
- `CancellationReason.ServiceStartFailure`: The ID Bolt service failed to start

Example:
```ts
...
	onCancellation: (reason) => {
		switch (reason) {
			case CancellationReason.UserClosed:
				console.log("User closed the scanning window");
				break;
			case CancellationReason.ServiceStartFailure:
				console.log("ID Bolt service failed to start");

	...
```

## Anonymization Mode

Some countries have specific requirements for the anonymization of documents. ID-Bolt can be configured to not extract those sensitive fields from documents.
Black boxes cover sensitive data in result images.

The `AnonymizationMode` enum has the following values:

| Value             | Description                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |

| `ImagesOnly`      | Only images are anonymized            |
| `FieldsAndImages` | Both fields and images are anonymized |

Note that when image anonymization is enabled, the `FullWithImages` return data mode does not return full-frame images. Cropped images are still returned, if available.

Example:
```ts
	...
	anonymizationMode: AnonymizationMode.FieldsOnly,
	...
```
