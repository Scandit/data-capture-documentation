## 8.0.0

**Released**: November 4, 2025

### New Features

Scandit's SDK 8.0 marks the evolution of data capture from a high-performing scanning tool into an intelligent AI-powered workflow enabler. As frontline operations face mounting pressures with more data points to capture, increasingly complex workflows to navigate, and tighter resource constraints, SDK 8.0 delivers a set of innovations that: 
  * Adapt its scanning settings and UI to context by analyzing the scanning environment and user intent;
  * Automate the capture of any data format, barcode clustering, task handling or camera settings;
  * Accelerate critical use cases to maximize ROI through intuitive, streamlined scanning workflows, using interactive AR-guidance, adaptive UI and out-of-the-box custom-branded passenger experiences.

With SDK 8.0 businesses can transform data capture from a basic function to a strategic advantage. It enables intelligent scanning that:
  * Understands not just what is being scanned, but also what you want to scan and why you’re scanning it
  * Adapts accordingly by adjusting scanning settings and/or UI, understanding what comes next and how to guide users seamlessly through sophisticated tasks to ensure the highest level of productivity.

#### Core

* The Capacitor Kotlin plugin version used is now `1.9.25`, enabling support for projects using Capacitor 7.

#### Barcode

* Updated the Gradle version for all sample applications to 8.14.3.
* `BarcodeBatchBasicOverlay` and `BarcodeBatchBasicOverlayListener` now allow for nullable brushes.

#### Smart Label Capture

* [Smart Label Capture](/sdks/capacitor/label-capture/intro.md) is now available for Capacitor. It enables the capture of any label, regardless of its layout or format, and extracts the relevant information automatically. This is achieved through a combination of AI-based text recognition and barcode scanning, allowing users to capture all necessary data in a single scan. Smart Label Capture is ideal for applications such as inventory management, asset tracking, and logistics, where labels can vary widely in design and content.
* We’re introducing an enhancement that makes Smart Label Capture more robust and scalable by complementing its on-device model with a larger, more capable model. When the on-device model can’t capture certain labels, the SDK automatically escalates to this enhancement to handle complex or unforeseen cases with high accuracy and reliability. This capability is currently available in `beta`. If you’re interested in trying it, please contact Scandit Support. For configuration details, see `labelDefinition.adaptiveRecognitionEngine`.

#### ID

* Added `ElementsToRetain` to `MobileDocumentScanner`: The set of data elements that the application intends to retain from scanned mobile documents. This information is used to set the `IntentToRetain` flag in ISO 18013-5 mdoc requests, which is required for legal compliance with data protection standards. An empty set indicates no elements will be retained, and `IntentToRetain` will be set to `false` for all fields.
* ID Capture now supports full-frame anonymization.
* The result of `decodeMobileDriverLicenseViz`, which is currently returned as part of the `VizResult` within `CapturedId`, will now be provided through a new field named `mobileDocumentOcr`.
* Added `CapturedId::isCitizenPassport`, which indicates whether the passport was issued to a citizen of the issuing country. Returns `false` for travel documents such as refugee, stateless, or alien passports, and for any passports issued by organizations rather than states.
* The following Chinese travel permits now extract VIZ + MIZ data during double-sided scanning flows:
  * CT - Taiwan Residents Mainland Travel Permit
  * W - Mainland Residents Exit-Entry Permit to and from Hong Kong and Macao
  * CD - Mainland Residents Entry-Exit Permit to and from Taiwan

### Behavioral Changes

#### Barcode

* Symbology `RM4SCC` has been renamed to `ROYAL_MAIL_4STATE`.
* Changed the default highlight brush in SparkScan and Barcode Capture.

#### ID

* The configuration for the following documents has been changed as detailed below:
  * Australian mobile driver licenses (mDL) are now treated as normal documents, with no separate mode.
  * US Green Cards are now treated as residence permits.
* Removed the deprecated API `DateResult::toDate`. Use `DateResult::toLocalDate` or `DateResult::toUtcDate` instead.
* `fullName` now an optional field on all `IdCapture` result types and `capturedMrz` now an optional field on `MrzResult`.

### Bug Fixes

#### ID

* Fixed a bug that could get the scanner stuck when scanning a US passport card.

### Deprecations

#### Core

* `VideoResolution::Auto` is now deprecated. Please use the capture mode's `recommendedCameraSettings` for the best results.
