## 7.1.0-beta.2

**Released**: February 6, 2025

### New Features

#### Core

* `DataCaptureContext` has been adapted to work as a singleton.
  * You can use the `DataCaptureContext.SharedInstance` property to retrieve the singleton instance.
  * The license key must be set using `DataCaptureContext.Initialize`. This step is only required once. Once initialized, the context can be used as before.
  * It is important to call `DataCaptureContext.RemoveCurrentMode()` when the active mode is no longer needed, such as when navigating away from a screen used for scanning.
  * The following methods have been added (also see Deprecations, below, for removed methods):
    * `setMode`: Sets a mode to be the active mode in the context.
    * `removeCurrentMode`: Removes the currently active mode in the context.
    * `static sharedInstance`: Returns a singleton instance of DataCaptureContext. This instance is unusable until properly configured by calling initialize() on it.
    * `initialize(string licenseKey)`: Reinitializes the context by configuring it with a license key.
    * `initialize(string licenseKey, string? frameworkName, string? frameworkVersion, string? deviceName, string? externalId, DataCaptureContextSettings settings)`: Reinitializes the context by configuring it with new settings.
* Calling `DataCaptureContext.addMode()` or `DataCaptureContext.setMode()` now replaces the current mode with the new one, so it’s no longer needed to remove a mode when adding a new one.

#### Barcode

* MatrixScan Count now includes the ability to [cluster barcodes](/sdks/capacitor/matrixscan-count/advanced.md#clustering) that belong together. Barcodes can be auto-clustered based on their visual context, or manually grouped by the user by circling them on screen.
* MatrixScan Count now includes the concept of a `Barcode Spacial Grid`, bringing the ability to map totes in a grid-like structure. Scanned codes will be returned with their relative location and can be displayed in a map view. This allows for fast and error-free in-store picking using dedicated carts and totes. The following classes have been added:
  * `BarcodeSpatialGrid`
  * `BarcodeSpatialGridEditorView`
  * `BarcodeSpatialGridEditorViewSettings`
  * `BarcodeSpatialGridEditorViewListener`
* Introducing the Smart Duplicate Filter: unlike traditional time-based filters, this intelligent solution prevents re-scanning the same barcode unless intended, eliminating delays and improving accuracy. In user testing, it boosted task completion speeds by 10% and reduced unintentional barcode scans by 5% in workflows requiring intentional duplicate scans. Enable this new behavior by setting the existing `codeDuplicateFilter` property to the special value `-2` — now the default for both Barcode Capture and SparkScan. See the [documentation](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/capacitor/barcode-capture/api/barcode-capture-settings.html#property-scandit.datacapture.barcode.BarcodeCaptureSettings.CodeDuplicateFilter) for details.
* The following APIs have been added:
  * `BarcodeFindViewSettings`
    * `withHardwareTriggers()`
    * `hardwareTriggerEnabled()`
    * `hardwareTriggerKeyCode()`
  * `BarcodeFindView`
    * `shouldShowZoomControl`
    * `hardwareTriggerSupported`

#### ID

* Launched DataConsistency Verification, which identifies suspicious documents by verifying the consistency of data encoded in various parts of the document. This helps detect potential tampering or anomalies.
* Enhanced the scanning capabilities for specific document types. When `ScannerType::FullDocument` is enabled, seamless scanning is now supported even for documents where the Scandit DataCapture SDK offers only Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) scanning.
* Added support for scanning the Machine Readable Zone of  non-standard Indian passports, where an MRZ line consists of 42 characters instead of 44. 
* Added support for scanning the Machine Readable Zone of the Chinese Mainland Travel Permit issued for non-Chinese citizens being residents of Hong Kong or Macau.
* Unified the value of the sex field from VIZ and MRZ results so that it is always one of the values `female`, `male` or `unspecified`.

### Performance Improvements

#### Barcode

* We’ve increased the scan rate of 10% on our datasets of QR codes with high perspective distortion (so scanned at high angles). This is particularly important for cases such as receiving boxes or scanning shelf labels.

#### ID

* Scandit ID Scanning now uses an improved AI model to detect forged barcodes on US documents, which significantly improves accuracy.

### Behavioral Changes

* After further improving the scanning speed on color-inverted QR and MicroQR codes, these variations can now be scanned without having to set any specific setting (as opposed to before), offering a better experience to developers.

### Bug Fixes

#### Barcode

* Fixed the setting of the default scanning behavior in SparkScanView.

#### ID

* Fixed an issue where it was not possible to scan the Visual Inspection Zone of passports if a license included the Visual Inspection Zone flag, but no Machine Readable Zone flag. 
* Fixed an issue where the scanning would become unresponsive when scanning certain passports.
* Fixed an issue where the scanning would become unresponsive when scanning the back side of Romanian IDs.
* Fixed an issue where some residence permits were incorrectly identified as ID cards when scanning their Machine Readable Zone.
* Fixed an issue where it was not possible to scan an Irish Passport Card when `ScannerType::FullDocumentScanner` was enabled.
* Fixed an issue where the personal identification number was not correctly anonymized on certain passports.

### Deprecations

#### Core

* The following methods of `DataCaptureContext` have been removed:
  * `addMode`: Replaced by `setMode` as only one mode can be active at a time.
  * `removeAllModes`: Replaced by `removeCurrentMode` as only one mode can be active at a time.

#### Barcode

* The following APIs have been removed:
  * `BarcodeCountSettings.enableUnrecognizedBarcodeDetection`
  * `BarcodeCountView.getTextForUnrecognizedBarcodesDetectedHint`
  * `BarcodeCountView.setBrushForUnrecognizedBarcode`
  * `BarcodeCountView.setTextForUnrecognizedBarcodesDetectedHint`
  * `BarcodeCountViewListener.brushForUnrecognizedBarcode`
  * `BarcodeCountViewListener.onUnrecognizedBarcodeTapped`

## 7.0.0

**Released**: November 29, 2024

### New Features

Scandit's Smart Data Capture SDK v7.0 addresses the industry's toughest scanning challenges with innovative solutions at every layer. Our enhanced scanning engine is context-aware, understanding both the environment and user needs. This results in smoother integrations, a richer user experience, and improved scanning performance without compromising flexibility.

Version 7.0 also offers increased versatility by supporting multiple input formats including text and barcodes.

SparkScan, our flagship barcode scanning product, embodies the full potential of v7.0 with its versatile user interface coupled with a robust, out-of-the-box scanning engine. SparkScan's success is a testament to our commitment to delivering seamless, high-performance camera-based scanning solutions.

#### Barcode

* SparkScan introduces a completely redesigned user interface, enhancing ergonomics with a simplified API and in-demand customization options. These updates make SparkScan even more versatile, seamlessly integrating with various use cases and blending smoothly into any existing workflow and UI. See the [migration guide](/migrate-6-to-7.md#sparkscan) for more details.
* Added the `remove_delimiter_data` extension to the CODABAR symbology.
* The MatrixScan Find user interface is now optimized for 4:3 camera resolution.
* The [Barcode Generator](/sdks/capacitor/barcode-generator.md) is now available for Capacitor.
  * Barcode Generator now supports the generation of Aztec codes.


#### Core

* Added the following API for fetching all Open Source Software (OSS) license text and attributions for all OSS used by the Scandit SDK.
  * `DataCaptureContext.openSourceSoftwareLicenseInfo()`

#### ID

We’ve completely redesigned the ID Capture API to streamline document capture and validation. The latest version introduces enhanced configuration options and improved result structures for an intuitive integration experience. These include:

* Easily configure which documents you capture using `IdCaptureSettings.acceptedDocuments` and `IdCaptureSettings.rejectedDocuments`. Choose entire document classes or refine selections by specific countries for precise control.
* Use `IdCaptureSettings.scannerType` to specify which document sections are relevant for your capture process.
* With just two callbacks — `IdCaptureListener.onIdCaptured` for success and `IdCaptureListener.onIdRejected` for rejection — it's straightforward to understand outcomes and define next steps, making the API simpler and more intuitive.
* Access key aggregated data at the top level of `CapturedId` or retrieve details from specific document parts, such as `CapturedId.visualInspectionZone`, `CapturedId.machineReadableZone`, and `CapturedId.barcode`.
* Retrieve document images, including the complete frame, through `CapturedId.images`.

### Performance Improvements

* Improved tracking of 1D barcodes that are horizontally aligned.
* MatrixScan Count’s tracking robustness is improved with quick recovery of tracking failures.

### Breaking Changes

#### Barcode

* The MatrixScan API (`BarcodeTracking`) has been renamed to `BarcodeBatch`. All classes have been renamed accordingly (e.g. `BarcodeTrackingListener` → `BarcodeBatchListener`).

### Deprecations

In 7.0, we removed all APIs that were deprecated during the lifetime of 6.0. Before [migrating to 7.0](/migrate-6-to-7.md), we suggest upgrading to 6.28, fixing all deprecation warnings and then upgrading to 7.0.

#### Barcode

The following SparkScan APIs have been deprecated in 7.0:
  * `SparkScanView.TorchButtonVisible`
  * `SparkScanView.StopCapturingText`
  * `SparkScanView.StartCapturingText`
  * `SparkScanView.ResumeCapturingText`
  * `SparkScanView.ScanningCapturingText`
  * `SparkScanView.CaptureButtonBackgroundColor`
  * `SparkScanView.CaptureButtonActiveBackgroundColor`
  * `SparkScanView.CaptureButtonTintColor`

#### Text Capture

Text Capture functionality has been deprecated in 7.0. If your use case requires text recognition, we recommend using Smart Label Capture instead.

#### ID

The legacy ID Capture UI has been removed in 7.0. If you are using the legacy UI, you must migrate to the new ID Capture API.
