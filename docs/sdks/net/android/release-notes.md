## 8.0.0

**Released**: November 4, 2025

### New Features

Scandit's SDK 8.0 marks the evolution of data capture from a high-performing scanning tool into an intelligent AI-powered workflow enabler. As frontline operations face mounting pressures with more data points to capture, increasingly complex workflows to navigate, and tighter resource constraints, SDK 8.0 delivers a set of innovations that: 
  * Adapt its scanning settings and UI to context by analyzing the scanning environment and user intent;
  * Automate the capture of any data format, barcode clustering, task handling or camera settings;
  * Accelerate critical use cases to maximize ROI through intuitive, streamlined scanning workflows, using interactive AR-guidance, adaptive UI and out-of-the-box custom-branded passenger experiences.

With SDK 8.0 businesses can transform data capture from a basic function to a strategic advantage. It enables intelligent scanning that:
  * Understands not just what is being scanned, but also what you want to scan and why you’re scanning it
  * Adapts accordingly by adjusting scanning settings and/or UI, understanding what comes next and how to guide users seamlessly through sophisticated tasks to ensure the highest level of productivity.

#### Core

* We've fundamentally redesigned our .NET SDK's architecture to better align with the modern .NET ecosystem!
  * **Platform-Agnostic .net8.0 and net9.0 Targets**: The SDK now includes generic net8.0 and .net9.0 targets. This allows you to reference `Scandit.DataCapture.Core` and related packages directly from non-UI projects, such as class libraries or unit test projects. This makes it significantly easier to build modular, testable applications following principles like Clean Architecture.
* **Mandatory SDK Initialization**: Due to the architectural changes, the SDK now requires explicit initialization at application startup. The public API has not changed, but you must add the corresponding initialization code to your application for the SDK to function correctly.

#### ID

* Added `ElementsToRetain` to `MobileDocumentScanner`: The set of data elements that the application intends to retain from scanned mobile documents. This information is used to set the `IntentToRetain` flag in ISO 18013-5 mdoc requests, which is required for legal compliance with data protection standards. An empty set indicates no elements will be retained, and `IntentToRetain` will be set to `false` for all fields.
* ID Capture now supports full-frame anonymization.
* The result of `decodeMobileDriverLicenseViz`, which is currently returned as part of the `VizResult` within `CapturedId`, will now be provided through a new field named `mobileDocumentOcr`.
* Added `CapturedId::isCitizenPassport`, which indicates whether the passport was issued to a citizen of the issuing country. Returns `false` for travel documents such as refugee, stateless, or alien passports, and for any passports issued by organizations rather than states.
* The following Chinese travel permits now extract VIZ + MIZ data during double-sided scanning flows:
  * CT - Taiwan Residents Mainland Travel Permit
  * W - Mainland Residents Exit-Entry Permit to and from Hong Kong and Macao
  * CD - Mainland Residents Entry-Exit Permit to and from Taiwan

### Behavioral Changes

#### Barcode

* Symbology `RM4SCC` has been renamed to `ROYAL_MAIL_4STATE`.
* Changed the default highlight brush in SparkScan and Barcode Capture.

#### ID

* The configuration for the following documents has been changed as detailed below:
  * Australian mobile driver licenses (mDL) are now treated as normal documents, with no separate mode.
  * US Green Cards are now treated as residence permits.
* Removed the deprecated API `DateResult::toDate`. Use `DateResult::toLocalDate` or `DateResult::toUtcDate` instead.
* `fullName` now an optional field on all `IdCapture` result types and `capturedMrz` now an optional field on `MrzResult`.

### Bug Fixes

#### ID

* Fixed a bug that could get the scanner stuck when scanning a US passport card.

### Deprecations

#### Core

* `VideoResolution::Auto` is now deprecated. Please use the capture mode's `recommendedCameraSettings` for the best results.

#### Barcode

* All previously deprecated APIs have been removed in this release.
