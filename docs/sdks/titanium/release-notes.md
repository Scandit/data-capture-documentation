## 8.1.0

**Released**: December 17, 2025

### New Features

#### Barcode

* Extended Aztec codes reader to support scanning mirrored codes.
* Added support for square DataMatrix codes with one-sided damage or occlusion. This feature is only enabled in Barcode Capture and SparkScan.

### Performance Improvements

#### Barcode

* Improved MicroQR detector tolerance to quiet zone violations
* Improved suppression of incorrect Codabar recognitions when using the [“strict" symbology extension](../symbology-properties#symbology-extension-descriptions)

### Behavioral Changes

#### Barcode

* Enabling the [“ocr_fallback" symbology extension](../symbology-properties#symbology-extension-descriptions) with missing OCR model resources now triggers the context error 28 (“Missing Resource”)

### Bug Fixes

#### Barcode

* Fixed a rare out-of-bound memory access crash when scanning low-resolution or blurry `EAN13/UPCA` codes at a specific distance
* Fixed a bug in the default color of BarcodeCapture highlights
* Fixed an issue where popover annotations with HIGHLIGHT_TAP_AND_BARCODE_SCAN trigger could not be opened again
* Fixed an issue in BarcodeSequence where camera would not be ON in portrait
* Fixed an issue where SparkScan mini preview would sometimes stay in regular when entering target mode
* Fixed the app becoming unresponsive after being in the background for extended periods
* Added the `cameraStateOnStop` property to BarcodeFindView to optimize camera transitions when switching between modes

#### Core

* Fixed a bug that could in rare cases produce a black screen when starting the camera
* Fixed a small memory leak that affected fresh install runs only
* Fixed an issue where barcode scanning would permanently stop after the app returned from background, particularly when camera permission dialogs were shown during initialization

## 8.0.1

**Released**: January 14, 2026

### Bug Fixes

#### Barcode

* Fixed an issue where the successful hint in BarcodeFind was not displayed
* Fixed a rare out-of-bound memory access crash when scanning low-resolution or blurry `EAN13/UPCA` codes at a specific distance

#### Core

* Fixed an issue where the camera would not restart when opened from another app
* Fixed an issue where the interface and video feed could have different visual orientations
* Fixed a bug that could in rare cases produce a black screen when starting the camera
* Fixed a small memory leak that affected fresh install runs only

## 8.0.0

**Released**: November 4, 2025

### New Features

Scandit's SDK 8.0 marks the evolution of data capture from a high-performing scanning tool into an intelligent AI-powered workflow enabler. As frontline operations face mounting pressures with more data points to capture, increasingly complex workflows to navigate, and tighter resource constraints, SDK 8.0 delivers a set of innovations that: 
  * Adapt its scanning settings and UI to context by analyzing the scanning environment and user intent;
  * Automate the capture of any data format, barcode clustering, task handling or camera settings;
  * Accelerate critical use cases to maximize ROI through intuitive, streamlined scanning workflows, using interactive AR-guidance, adaptive UI and out-of-the-box custom-branded passenger experiences.

With SDK 8.0 businesses can transform data capture from a basic function to a strategic advantage. It enables intelligent scanning that:
  * Understands not just what is being scanned, but also what you want to scan and why you’re scanning it
  * Adapts accordingly by adjusting scanning settings and/or UI, understanding what comes next and how to guide users seamlessly through sophisticated tasks to ensure the highest level of productivity.

#### Core

* Upgraded minimum Titanium SDK to `12.7.0.GA` and build modules with Titanium `13.0.0.GA` to enable 16 KB page size support.

#### Barcode

* Updated the Gradle version for all sample applications to 8.14.3.

### Behavioral Changes

#### Barcode

* Symbology `RM4SCC` has been renamed to `ROYAL_MAIL_4STATE`.
* Changed the default highlight brush in Barcode Capture.

### Bug Fixes

### Deprecations

#### Core

* `VideoResolution::Auto` is now deprecated. Please use the capture mode's `recommendedCameraSettings` for the best results.
