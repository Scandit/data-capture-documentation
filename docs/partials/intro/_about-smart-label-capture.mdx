Smart Label Capture enables workflows that require reading information from one or multiple texts and barcodes. 
By combining barcode recognition with OCR with inbuilt intelligence it can understand the context of the data and extract only the relevant fields for your application.

## Understanding Labels in Smart Label Capture

The first step to using Smart Label Capture is to define the labels that you want to capture.
A label is a collection of text and barcode fields that are meant to be scanned in one scan process.

To intelligently extract only the fields that are relevant, Smart Label Capture relies on a combination of multiple cues:

* The content of texts or barcodes
* The barcode symbology
* The relative position of fields
* Textual context, i.e. text that is close to the field and describes it's meaning

import LabelCapture from "../../../src/components/IconComponents/LabelCapture";

Label fields can be defined as optional, so that they are only captured if they are present.

## Applications and Use Cases for Smart Label Capture

To illustrate how Smart Label Capture can be used, let's look at a few examples.
While the `LabelCapture` API allows configuring arbitray labels, the following examples should give an idea of the versatility and applications of this data capture mode.

* <strong>Retail Products</strong>
<br/>Streamline in-store order fulfillment by capturing barcodes, expiry dates, net weights and other texts automatically.<br/><img src="/img/batch-scanning/SLC-retail.gif" width="400px" alt="Label Capture workflow for scanning smart device labels" />
* <strong>Smart Device Labels with Multiple Barcodes</strong>
<br/>Read UPC, serial number, IMEI1 and IMEI2 and other data from smart devices labels, regardless of the design and format of the individual label.<br/><img src="/img/batch-scanning/SLC-smart-devices.gif" width="400px" alt="Label Capture workflow for scanning smart device labels" />
* <strong>Price Labels</strong>
<br/>Recognize price, barcodes and other texts to verify prices and check stock.
* <strong>Loyalty and Gift Card Scanning</strong>
<br/>Smart Label Capture can read texts to avoid manual data entry for loyalty numbers and gift card codes.
* <strong>And many more...</strong>
<br/>The flexibility of Smart Label Capture allows it to be used in a wide range of different applications. To implement your own use case, have a look at the `LabelCapture` API documentation. Contact us to get support for your specific use case.
