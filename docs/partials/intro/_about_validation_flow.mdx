## Validation Flow

Validation Flow is a ready-to-use workflow in Smart Label Capture that streamlines the capture and validation of label data with minimal code.

If any fields are missed or need correction, users can easily review and manually add or fix data, ensuring complete and accurate results without having to rescan the entire label - even when the targeted fields are not close together (multi-step scanning).
