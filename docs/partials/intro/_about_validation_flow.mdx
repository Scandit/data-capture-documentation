## Validation Flow

Validation Flow is a workflow available in Smart Label Capture to improve the accuracy and completeness of scanned label data in real-world environments. This feature allows users to confirm OCR results, manually correct errors, or individually capture missing fields without needing to rescan the entire label.

It addresses common issues such as glare, occlusion, and poor lighting that lead to incomplete label reads, helping you maintain high data integrity for expiry dates, lot numbers, weights, and prices.

### Workflow States

The Validation Flow consists of five main states:

| State    | Description     |
|--------|---------------------|
| `Initial State` | Tries full label scan. Proceeds to validation if successful, otherwise waits. |
| `Validation State`     | Camera paused. Users review/correct data or trigger rescans.   |
| `Manual Input State`   | Allows keyboard input for individual fields.    |
| `Target Scanning State`| Focused scan for a single field.  |
| `Standby State`        | Entered after timeout or inactivity. |
