MatrixScan Check enables you to build applications and workflows involving augmented reality overlays to highlight barcodes and display additional information over them.

MatrixScan is powered by the `BarcodeCheck` functionality of the Scandit Smart Data Capture SDK. It can be used to add the following customizabe UI elements to your workflows:

* **Highlights**: Used to enable the user to identify the scanned barcode. They are shown on top of the respective barcode and displayed as soon as the barcode is scanned.
* **Annotations**: Displayed outside of the area of a barcode and attach to the scanned barcode. There are multiple types of annotations available:
    * **Info**: Comprised of any desired combination of text and/or icons.
    * **Status Icons**: The collapsed icon is shown as soon as the barcode is scanned. It expands to display the icon and any desired text when the user taps on it, and collapses once tapped again.
    * **Popovers**: Comprised of any desired combination of text and icons. Popovers appear upon tapping the respective highlight and can be configured to appear on scan. They are removed on tapping the highlight or area inside the popover.
