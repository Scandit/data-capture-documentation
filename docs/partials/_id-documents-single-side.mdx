### Single Side Scanner

#### Machine Readable Zone (MRZ)

The machine readable zone mode of the ID Capture `SingleSideScanner` supports all versions of machine readable travel documents (MRTD) specified by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This includes all documents of the types TD1, TD2, TD3/MRP and MRV. In addition, ID Capture supports some non-ICAO standards. 

Machine-readable zones are captured and parsed so that the data can be accessed via `CapturedId`. To access the raw MRZ data, consult the documentation of `MrzResult`.

#### Visual Inspection Zone

The visual inspection zone mode of the ID Capture `SingleSideScanner` supports capturing human-readable text. It supports all documents listed in the `FullDocumentScanner` section. In contrast to the `FullDocumentScanner`, the `SingleSideScanner` only scans the front side of the document and only extracts data from the human-readable text while barcodes and MRZ are ignored. 

The extracted data can be accessed via `CapturedId`. To access the raw text data, consult the documentation of `VizResult`.
