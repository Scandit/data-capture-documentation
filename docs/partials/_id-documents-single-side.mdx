### Single-Side Scanner

This scanner performs data extraction on specific parts of the document, focusing only on one side.

#### Machine Readable Zone (MRZ)

The single-side scanner's machine-readable zone mode is compatible with all machine-readable travel documents (MRTD) as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Additionally, it supports certain non-ICAO standards.

Captured MRZ data is parsed and can be accessed through the `CapturedId` interface. For details on retrieving raw MRZ data, please refer to the `MrzResult` documentation.

#### Barcode

The single-side scanner's barcode mode extracts data from ID documents with PDF417 barcodes.

Barcodes are captured and parsed so that the data can be accessed via `CapturedId`. To access the raw barcode data, consult the documentation of `BarcodeResult`.

#### Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ)

The single-side scanner's Visual Inspection Zone mode extracts human-readable text from documents. Unlike the full document scanner, this mode focuses solely on the front side of the document, extracting only the visible text while ignoring barcodes and machine-readable zones.

Extracted text data is accessible through the `CapturedId` interface. For more information on retrieving raw text data, please refer to the `VizResult` documentation.
