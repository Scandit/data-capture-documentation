## Native SDK

### iOS

| Requirement | Version |
| ----------- | ------- |
| iOS         | 14.0+   |
| Architecture| arm64, x86_64 |
| Camera      | 720p+   |
| GPU         |    |

### Android

| Requirement | Version |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Android     | 7.0+ (API level 24) |
| Java        | 8+     |
| Architecture| arm64v7, arm64, x86, x86_64 |
| Camera      | 720p+   |
| GPU         |    |

:::note
On Android hardware acceleration has to be enabled for the camera preview to work. Hardware acceleration is enabled by default since API level 14 but can potentially be turned off in the Manifest, do not do this if you use the camera.
:::

### Linux

Supported distributions:

* Ubuntu 18.04 or newer
* Debian/GNU Linux 10 (Buster) or newer
* Raspbian 2017-08-17 or newer

:::note
Most Debian/GNU Linux based systems should be supported as as long as the
dependency requirements below are met.

RedHat based systems (RPM packages) are not supported officially. The tool 'alien' can be used to convert the Debian packages to RPM packages. If you want to run the SDK on any other Linux 
distribution, unpack the `.deb` file and install the library and headers manually.

## Frameworks

These platforms are based on the native platforms and therefore the requirements of native platforms apply as well. If a framework has stricter requirements (e.g. it only supports newer versions of Android/iOS) it is explicitly stated.

| Platform        | Requirements                                        |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Capacitor       | - Capacitor 5.0.0<br/>- Swift 4.0+                   |
| Cordova         | - cordova 12.0.0<br/>- cordova-android 10.0.0<br/>- cordova-ios 6.3.0<br/>- Swift 4.0+ |
| Flutter         | - Flutter 3.22.0+ (Dart 3.4.0+)<br/>- Swift 4.0+      |
| React Native    | - react-native 0.70+ (0.72+ recommended for modern toolchain support)<br/>- react-native 0.74.0+ required when using the New Architecture<br/>- Kotlin 1.9.25<br/>- Swift 4.0+ |
| Titanium        | - Titanium 13.0.0+                                |
| .NET for iOS    | - .NET SDK 6.0.403+                                 |

:::warning
**React Native Known Issues:** While Our SDK integrates perfectly with React Native 0.70.x, this version has known build toolchain compatibility issues with modern development environments (unrelated to the Scandit SDK). These are React Native framework limitations and not caused by the Scandit SDK. We recommend using React Native 0.72+ to avoid these issues.:
    * Android Gradle Plugin version conflicts
    * Kotlin version incompatibilities
    * AndroidX dependency version matrix issues
:::

:::note
**React Native New Architecture:** The React Native team is actively evolving the New Architecture implementation with significant improvements in each release. We recommend using the latest available version of React Native when working with the New Architecture to benefit from the most recent stability and performance enhancements.
