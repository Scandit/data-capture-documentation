This page describes the steps to configure a barcode based capture mode to read only the specific barcodes you require.

When integrating Scandit barcode scanning into your application, you must configure the type(s) of barcodes that you need to scan. Generally, it is best to enable only those symbologies you need, as this ensures the best performance and user experience. No symbologies are enabled by default, to enable scanning of a particular barcode, its symbology must be enabled.

:::tip
If you are unsure what symbologies you need to scan, use the Scandit Demo App available in the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scandit-sdk-showcase/id453880584) and [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scandit.demoapp). After you have installed the app, select the “Any Code” mode and scan the codes you are interested in. The name of the symbology appears on the result screen.

See the [Barcode Symbologies](/docs/barcode-symbologies.md) page for all supported barcode types. Additionally, the available symbol count range, checksum, extensions, etc., for all symbologies are listed in [Symbology Properties](/symbology-properties.md).
