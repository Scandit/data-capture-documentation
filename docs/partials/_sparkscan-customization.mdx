You can customize many aspects of the default SparkScan UI and UX to suit your needs and particular use case. These customizations include the:

* Colors of all items (i.e. icons, buttons, toolbar)
* Trigger button icon
* All toast messages
* Size of the preview
* Visibility of any/all icons
* Trigger button

### Trigger button

The default trigger button in SparkScan has been designed based on our experience and feedback received to be generally suited across a multitude of industry use cases, custom trigger implementations are still supported.

This is achieved by hiding the default trigger button (via `sparkScanView.isTriggerButtonVisible`), and then controlling the scanning process as best suits your needs:

* Using a custom button embedded in you app to call `sparkScanView.startScanning()` to start scanning; and
* Using the mini-preview close button (via `sparkScanView.previewCloseControlVisible`) or your desired button (via `sparkScanView.pauseScanning()`) to stop scanning.

Alternatively, you can rely entirely on a hardware button, if you have enabled that feature.

### Settings Toolbar

The Settings Toolbar is hidden by default in SparkScan, as the most relevant controls are already visible in the camera preview.
However, additional advanced controls can be made available, such as:

* Target Mode
* Continuos Mode

By enabling the visibility of these buttons, the Settings Toolbar will appear at the bottom of the camera preview.

### Add Advanced Scanning Modes to the Toolbar

SparkScan is our best solution for high-speed single scanning and scan-intensive workflows. Depending on your use case, you can use SparkScan in conjunction with other Scandit advanced scanning modes, such as MatrixScan Find or MatrixScan Count, to speed up your workflows.

SparkScan offers pre-build buttons you can add to the setting toolbar to easily move to different scan modes from within the SparkScan UI.

First you will need to show these buttons:

```sh
// Show the MatrixScan Count and MatrixScan Find buttons
sparkScanView.barcodeCountButtonVisible = true;
sparkScanView.barcodeFindButtonVisible = true;
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/sparkscan/toolbar.png" alt="Toolbar without Scanning Modes" /><br></br>The standard toolbar without additional scanning modes added.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/img/sparkscan/toolbar-buttons.png" alt="Toolbar with Scanning Modes" /><br></br>The toolbar with MatrixScan Find and MatrixScan Count buttons.
</p>

In addition you have to add a listener to the `SparkScanView` via `SparkScanView.setListener()`. You will then receive callbacks when the MatrixScan Find button or MatrixScan Count button is tapped from the toolbar.
