You can customize many aspects of the default SparkScan UI and UX to suit your needs and particular use case. These customizations include the:

* Colors of all items (i.e. icons, buttons, toolbar)
* Trigger button icon
* All toast messages
* Size of the preview
* Visibility of any/all icons
* Trigger button

### Trigger button

The default trigger button in SparkScan has been designed based on our experience and feedback received to be generally suited across a multitude of industry use cases, custom trigger implementations are still supported.

This is achieved by hiding the default trigger button (via `sparkScanView.isTriggerButtonVisible`), and then controlling the scanning process as best suits your needs:

* Using a custom button embedded in you app to call `sparkScanView.startScanning()` to start scanning; and
* Using the mini-preview close button (via `sparkScanView.previewCloseControlVisible`) or your desired button (via `sparkScanView.pauseScanning()`) to stop scanning.

Alternatively, you can rely entirely on a hardware button, if you have enabled that feature.
