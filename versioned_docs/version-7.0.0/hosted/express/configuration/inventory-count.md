# Inventory Count

Scandit Express can also be used to count inventory. This will be available through the **Inventory Count** option in the Scandit Express app.

On start, you will have two options: 

* **Count without List** which will allow you to start scanning products and then export a list of them.
* **Load Order List** which allows you to scan a QR code containing a list of expected barcodes and then check against that list the barcodes you scan and generate an order confirmation.
