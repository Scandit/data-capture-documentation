Clustering is a feature that enables grouping multiple barcodes together, either based upon their visual context or manually by the user.

By default, clustering is disabled. It is configured via setting `ClusteringMode` to one of the following available options:

* `DISABLED`: No clustering is performed.
* `MANUAL`: Manual clustering is supported. The user can select which barcodes to cluster using the on-screen UI.
* `AUTO`: Clustering is automatically performed and cannot be manually tuned.
* `AUTO_WITH_MANUAL_CORRECTION`: Clustering is performed automatically, but clusters can also be formed or dissolved manually using the UI.
