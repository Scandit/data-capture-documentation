For you app to read a given type of symbology, you need to enable it in the capture settings of the barcode capture mode you are using. For example:

* `SparkScanSettings.SparkScanSettings()` for SparkScan
* `BarcodeCaptureSettings.enableSymbology()` for barcode capture
* `BarcodeBatchSettings.enableSymbology()` for barcode batch (MatrixScan)
