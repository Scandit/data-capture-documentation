**Released**: October 8, 2024

### New Features

#### Barcode

* BarcodeFind is an API that implements [MatrixScan Find](/sdks/web/matrixscan-find/intro.md). MatrixScan Find is a pre-built UI that uses augmented reality overlays to highlight items that match predefined criteria. It allows you to add a search and find experience with augmented reality to an existing native app, with just a few lines of code.
  * Added [`BarcodeFindTransformer`](https://docs.scandit.com/6.28/data-capture-sdk/web/barcode-capture/api/barcode-find-transformer.html).
* On Barcode Capture and SparkScan, we optimized the frame processing time in 4k-UHD resolution with dynamic resolution selection, resulting in up to 35% reduction on high-end devices and consistent performance improvements across all supported devices.
platforms.

#### ID

* ID Capture now supports scanning:
  * Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ) on the back of the European Health Insurance Card.
  * Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ) of New York City IDs.
  * Florida Medical Marijuana IDs.
* Added Blood Type and Sponsor fields to [`CapturedResultType.VizResult`](https://docs.scandit.com/6.28/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/captured-id.html#property-scandit.datacapture.id.CapturedId.Viz).

### Bug Fixes

#### Barcode

* Fixed result data encoding classification for raw byte data in 2d barcodes, in particular for Shift-JIS encoding.
* Resolved cases in which Smart Scan Intention was possibly reporting the wrong barcode when when the camera was quickly changing direction with a single barcode in the scene.
* Fixed an issue where it was not possible to scan non-fluorescent French-Post barcodes without the extension `fluorescent_orange_ink`.
* Fixed a bug where importing the SDK in a node environment would cause an error.
* Fixed an issue where, in rare cases, the page was not scrolling after detaching the DataCaptureView.

## 6.24.0

**Released**: May 8, 2024

### New Features

#### Barcode

- **Smart Scan Intention**: Introduced a new algorithm named "smart" that intelligently identifies and scans the intended barcode, reducing errors. It can be manually set in Barcode Capture (`BarcodeCaptureSettings.scanIntention`).

Users can configure the view displayed for a barcode and its relative position by implementing `BarcodeTrackingAdvancedOverlayListener` or by calling `BarcodeTrackingAdvancedOverlay.setViewForTrackedBarcode()`, `BarcodeTrackingAdvancedOverlay.setAnchorForTrackedBarcode()`, or `BarcodeTrackingAdvancedOverlay.setOffsetForTrackedBarcode()`. For more information, refer to the "Add AR Overlays in MatrixScan" documentation.

#### ID

- **Rejection Reason**: Added `RejectedId.rejectionReason` to provide the reason why a document was rejected.

  - Mexico: Matrícula Consular

- **New Feature for French Passports**: Added `CapturedId.secondaryLastName` containing the common name (“nom d’usage”) on French passports.

### Performance Improvements

### New Features

#### Barcode

- Updated the camera behavior to overcome the scanning challenges found on the iPhone 13 Pro (Max) and iPhone 14 Pro (Max) when using the built-in camera for barcode scanning. Our testing showed that barcodes that are less than 2 cm or ~1 inch in size (and usually have such small features) were impacted.

#### ID

- New textual hints and animations guide the user if the camera is too close or too far to capture a document.
- Redesigned ID Capture viewfinders to enable smoother drawing performance.
- For ID cards issued by the United Arab Emirates, data parsed from the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) is now returned automatically when `IdDocumentType.IdCardVIZ` and `SupportedSides.FrontAndBack` are selected.
- Added textual hints and animations appearing when the document is detected to be too close or too far from the camera.
- Improved recognition of cropped ID document images when using the `SingleImageUploader` frame source.

#### Core

- Added property `SingleImageUploaderSettings.onlyCameraCapture` to force the image to be captured by the camera instead of allowing the selection of an image from the device’s photo library.
- Added `ImageFrameSource`. This new type of `FrameSource` allows processing a single image, file, or [`ImageData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData).
- Added `Camera.settings` to `Camera`.

### Bug Fixes

#### ID

- Fixed an issue where hints were not being shown when the `DataCaptureView` is attached after the `id.IdCapture` instance is created.

#### Core

- Restored some logs that were not being properly sent to the console anymore.

### API Changes

#### ID

- Added `IdCaptureOverlay.setMoveCloserTextHint()` and `IdCaptureOverlay.setMoveFurtherAwayTextHint()` that allow setting custom text for textual hints displayed when scanning a document.
