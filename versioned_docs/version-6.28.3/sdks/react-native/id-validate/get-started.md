# Get Started

This guide will help you get started with Scandit ID Validate. There are two verifiers available:

* [`AAMVAVizBarcodeComparisonVerifier`](https://docs.scandit.com/6.28/data-capture-sdk/react-native/id-capture/api/aamva-viz-barcode-comparison-verifier.html#class-scandit.datacapture.id.AamvaVizBarcodeComparisonVerifier): Validates the authenticity of the document by comparing the data from the VIZ and from the barcode on the back.
* [`AAMVABarcodeVerifier`](https://docs.scandit.com/6.28/data-capture-sdk/react-native/id-capture/api/aamva-barcode-verifier.html#class-scandit.datacapture.id.AamvaBarcodeVerifier): Validates the authenticity of the document by analyzing the barcode on the back.

Integrating ID Validate into your app follows the same general steps as [integrating ID Capture](../id-capture/get-started.md), with some minor differences based on the verifier you choose, as detailed in the following sections.

## VIZ Barcode Comparison Verifier

This verifier compares the data from the VIZ (the machine-readable zone) and the barcode on the back of the document and requires the front and back scanning mode.

Create the verifier and initialize [`IdCapture`](https://docs.scandit.com/6.28/data-capture-sdk/react-native/id-capture/api/id-capture.html#class-scandit.datacapture.id.IdCapture) with the following settings:

```javascript
const dataCaptureContext = DataCaptureContext.forLicenseKey("-- ENTER YOUR SCANDIT LICENSE KEY HERE --")

const verifier = AamvaVizBarcodeComparisonVerifier.create()

const settings = new IdCaptureSettings()
settings.supportedDocuments = [IdDocumentType.DLVIZ]
settings.supportedSides = SupportedSides.FrontAndBack

const idCapture = IdCapture.forContext(dataCaptureContext, settings)
```

Then proceed to capture the front and back sides of a document as usual. After you capture the back side and receive the combined result for both sides, you may run the verifier as follows:

```javascript
const idCaptureListener = {
    didCaptureId: (_, session) => {
        const capturedId = session.newlyCapturedId
        const vizResult = capturedId.vizResult

        if (vizResult && vizResult.capturedSides === SupportedSides.FrontAndBack) {
            verifier
                .verify(session.newlyCapturedId)
                .then(result => {
                    if (result.checksPassed) {
                        // Nothing suspicious was detected.
                    } else {
                        // You may inspect the results of individual checks, if you wish:
                        if (result.datesOfBirthMatch.checkResult === ComparisonCheckResult.Failed) {
                          // The holderâ€™s date of birth from the front side does not match the one encoded in the barcode.
                        }
                    }
                })
        }
    }
}
```

The return value allows you to query both the overall result of the verification and the results of individual checks. See [`AAMVAVizBarcodeComparisonResult`](https://docs.scandit.com/6.28/data-capture-sdk/react-native/id-capture/api/aamva-viz-barcode-comparison-verifier.html#class-scandit.datacapture.id.AamvaVizBarcodeComparisonResult) for details.

## Barcode Verifier

This verifier analyzes the barcode on the back of the document and works with either single-sided or front and back scanning modes.

Start with creating a capture context and the verifier:

```javascript
const dataCaptureContext = DataCaptureContext.forLicenseKey("-- ENTER YOUR SCANDIT LICENSE KEY HERE --")
const barcodeVerifier = await AamvaBarcodeVerifier.create(dataCaptureContext)
```

Then initialize the desired scanning mode:

```javascript
// Single-sided scanning mode
const settings = new IdCaptureSettings()
settings.supportedDocuments = [IdDocumentType.AAMVABarcode]

const idCapture = IdCapture.forContext(dataCaptureContext, settings)

// Front and back scanning mode
const settings = new IdCaptureSettings()
settings.supportedDocuments = [IdDocumentType.DLVIZ]
settings.supportedSides = SupportedSides.FrontAndBack

const idCapture = IdCapture.forContext(dataCaptureContext, settings)
```

Once the capture is complete, trigger the verification process. This process is asynchronous and the result will be delivered once the verification has been completed:

```javascript
const idCaptureListener = {
    didCaptureId: (_, session) => {
        const capturedId = session.newlyCapturedId
        const barcode = capturedId.aamvaBarcodeResult

        if (barcode) {
            barcodeVerifier
                .then(verifierInstance => {
                    verifierInstance
                        .verify(session.newlyCapturedId)
                        .then(result => {
                                if (result.allChecksPassed) {
                                    // Nothing suspicious was detected.
                                } else {
                                    // Document may be fraudulent or tampered with - proceed with caution.
                                }
                            }, (error) => {
                                // Error occurred during verification
                            }
                        })
                })
        }
    }
}
```
