# About ID Validate

ID Validate builds upon the functionality provided by Scandit [ID Capture](../id-capture/intro.md) to enable the verification of personal identification documents. ID Validate provides the capability to conduct complex analysis of identity documents to verify if they are real or fake.

Scandit ID Capture and Validation software captures data from IDs using a combination of text recognition (optical character recognition/OCR), barcode scanning, and image recognition. This data can be instantly analyzed, on-device, to determine if the ID is authentic.

ID Validate runs on any smart device with a camera, including smartphones, tablets, and dedicated scanners.
