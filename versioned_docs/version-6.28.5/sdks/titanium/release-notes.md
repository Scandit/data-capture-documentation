platforms.

### Bug Fixes

#### Barcode

* Fixed result data encoding classification for raw byte data in 2d barcodes, in particular for Shift-JIS encoding.
* Resolved cases in which Smart Scan Intention was possibly reporting the wrong barcode when when the camera was quickly changing direction with a single barcode in the scene.
