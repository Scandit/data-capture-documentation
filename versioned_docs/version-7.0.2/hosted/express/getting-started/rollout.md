# Production Rollout

For production use, Scandit Express is typically distributed via a mobile device management (MDM) or enterprise mobility management (EMM) system. This page will guide you rolling out Scandit Express using such a system for either Android or iOS.

This involves adding Scandit Express to your MDM/EMM solution's app catalog, and setting the project code to synchronize the Scandit Express configuration automatically to all devices.

:::note
The screenshots in this guide are from MobileIron Cloud. However, these instructions apply to MDM/EMM solutions from most vendors.

## iOS

You can distribute Scandit Express directly from the Apple App Store. Search for "Scandit Express" in the admin console of your EMM/MDM solution and add it to your app catalog.

### Set the Project Code

To automatically synchronize your Scandit Express configuration with Scandit, you need to set the project code in the management console of your MDM/EMM solution. Once set, your users won't have to manually activate Scandit Express via QR code. Configuration changes are also automatically distributed to all devices.

1. Login to your [Scandit Dashboard](https://ssl.scandit.com/).

2. Click on your project card.

3. From the Project dashboard, click the **Copy Project Code** link.

4. In your MDM system, paste this value in the **iOS Managed App Configuration** section.

:::note
If your MDM system requires an AppConfig configuration, you can generate one [here](https://appconfig.jamfresearch.com/generator) by selecting Scandit Express as: `com.scandit.KeyboardWedge2/current`.

## Android

Scandit Express for Android supports MDM/EMM deployment via [Android Managed Configurations](https://developer.android.com/work/managed-configurations).

:::warning
Please note that Scandit Express might not be compatible with some Android for Work configurations (e.g. 3rd-party keyboards such as Scandit Express can typically not be installed in a work profile).

Scandit recommends setting Android devices as either ["fully managed"](https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/9562029?hl=en&ref_topic=9563482&sjid=2353681360583047853-EU) and ["dedicated devices"](https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/9560920?hl=en&ref_topic=9563482&sjid=2353681360583047853-EU).

You can distribute Scandit Express directly from the Google Play Store. Search for "Scandit Express" in the admin console for your EMM/MDM solution and add it to your app catalog.

### Set the Project Code

To automatically synchronize your Scandit Express configuration with Scandit, you need to set the project code in the management console of your MDM/EMM solution. Once set, your users won't have to manually activate Scandit Express via QR code. Configuration changes are also automatically distributed to all devices.

1. Login to your [Scandit Dashboard](https://ssl.scandit.com/).

2. Click on your project card.

3. The Android Scandit Express App specifies the following Application Restriction:
    ```java
    <restriction

       android:key="deploymentCode"

       android:title="Deployment Code"

       android:restrictionType="string"

       android:description="Defines which deployment on scandit.com the installed Scandit Express fetches its configuration and license from."

       android:defaultValue="" />
    ```

4. The `deploymentCode` value needs to be set by the admin of the Managed Configuration to the project code, which can be obtained on the Scandit Express Dashboard by clicking the **Copy Project Code** link.

5. In your MDM system, paste this value in the **Manage Configurations** section.
