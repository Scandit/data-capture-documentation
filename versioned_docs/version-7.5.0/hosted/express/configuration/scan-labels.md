# Scan Labels

Powered by [Smart Label Capture](/sdks/android/label-capture/intro/), a feature available in the Scandit Smart Data Capture SDK, this mode enables the simultaneous scanning of multiple barcodes and printed text on labels, streamlining data entry and reducing errors.

By combining barcode recognition with OCR and built-in intelligence, it can understand the context of the data and extract only the relevant fields for your application.

It is available via the **Scan Labels** option in the Express menu.

On start, you will be able to scan labels using the default configuration available out-of-the-box, however, your account administrator can customize the implementation to your specific use case, detailing the label layout, fields, and type of data to be extracted.

When finished scanning, you can export the list of scanned details.
