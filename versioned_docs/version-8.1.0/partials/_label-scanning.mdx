Smart Label Capture enables the simultaneous scanning of multiple barcodes and printed text on labels, streamlining data entry and reducing errors. By combining barcode recognition with OCR and built-in intelligence, it can understand the context of the data and extract only the relevant fields for your application.

Smart Label Capture, implemented via the `LabelCapture` API, is designed for applications that require efficient data extraction from labels.
