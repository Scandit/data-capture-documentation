### How to Calculate the Active Symbol Count

Calculating the active symbol count is symbology-specific as each symbology has a different symbol definition. To understand what a symbology's default active symbol count range is and to learn how to compute the active symbol count for a particular symbology, see [symbology properties](../../symbology-properties).

As an alternative, you can also use the Scandit Demo App (linked above). After you have installed the app and scanned the codes you are interested in, the active symbol count appears on the result screen.
