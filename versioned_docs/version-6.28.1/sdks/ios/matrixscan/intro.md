# About MatrixScan

MatrixScan is powered by the [`SDCBarcodeTracking`](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/ios/barcode-capture/api/barcode-tracking.html#class-scandit.datacapture.barcode.tracking.BarcodeTracking) functionality of the Scandit Smart Data Capture SDK.

## Limitations

* DotCode
* MaxiCode
* All postal codes (KIX, RM4SCC)
