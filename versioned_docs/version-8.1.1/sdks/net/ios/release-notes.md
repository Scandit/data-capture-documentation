## 8.1.1

**Released**: February 5, 2026

### Performance Improvements

#### Core

* Reduced intermittent memory spikes while configuring the barcode scanner across all capture modes

### Bug Fixes

#### Core

* Fixed an issue where the camera preview appeared rotated 90 degrees in landscape orientation
* Fixed an issue where the interface and video feed could have different visual orientations

## 8.1.0

**Released**: December 17, 2025

### New Features

#### Barcode

* Smart Scan Selection is now available in Barcode Capture. Scanning a single barcode is often difficult in environments where multiple barcodes are placed closely together, like on a densely packed warehouse shelf or on a package with various labels. This can lead to scanning the wrong item, causing errors and slowing down operations. Smart Scan Selection solves this problem by automatically detecting when a user is trying to scan in a "dense barcode" environment. The interface then intelligently adapts, providing an aimer to help the user precisely select the desired barcode without needing to manually change any settings. This creates a seamless and more intuitive scanning experience.
* Extended Aztec codes reader to support scanning mirrored codes.
* Added support for square DataMatrix codes with one-sided damage or occlusion. This feature is only enabled in Barcode Capture and SparkScan.
* Added, in `BarcodeAr`, a new annotation type (`BarcodeArResponsiveAnnotation`), which automatically switches between close-up and far-away info annotations based on the barcode's size on screen

#### Id

* Added NationalityISO property that maps results from Nationality field to country ISO code
* Added RejectionDiagnosticJSON property to CapturedId to report debug info during Timeout rejections
* Added support for new California DL, new South Carolina DL, Arizona Medical Marijuana Card, Kuwait Civil card, and new Texas DL
* Our SDK can now scan the following documents both in single-side and double-side mode:
  - All Mexican DLs
  - Mexican Voter Cards

### Performance Improvements

#### Barcode

* Improved MicroQR detector tolerance to quiet zone violations
* Improved suppression of incorrect Codabar recognitions when using the ["strict" symbology extension](../symbology-properties#symbology-extension-descriptions)

### Behavioral Changes

#### Barcode

* Enabling the ["ocr_fallback" symbology extension](../symbology-properties#symbology-extension-descriptions) with missing OCR model resources now triggers the context error 28 ("Missing Resource")

#### Core

* Added the `CodeDuplicate` class to simplify setting special sentinel values for the CodeDuplicateFilter property across barcode scanning modes.

### Bug Fixes

#### Barcode

* Fixed a rare out-of-bound memory access crash when scanning low-resolution or blurry `EAN13/UPCA` codes at a specific distance
* Added the `cameraStateOnStop` property to BarcodeFindView to optimize camera transitions when switching between modes

#### Id

* Fixed an issue where front expiry date anonymization rectangle is erroneously drawn on front and back
* Fixed a bug that prevented VizResult anonymization of the following fields: additionalAddressInformation, bloodType, employer, fathersName, issuingAuthority, maritalStatus, mothersName, placeOfBirth, profession, race, residentialStatus
* Fixed a bug concerning return complete instead of cropped images on the back of EU driving licenses

#### Core

* Fixed a small memory leak that affected fresh install runs only
* Fixed an issue where barcode scanning would permanently stop after the app returned from background, particularly when camera permission dialogs were shown during initialization

## 8.0.1

**Released**: January 14, 2026

## 8.0.0

**Released**: November 4, 2025

### New Features

Scandit's SDK 8.0 marks the evolution of data capture from a high-performing scanning tool into an intelligent AI-powered workflow enabler. As frontline operations face mounting pressures with more data points to capture, increasingly complex workflows to navigate, and tighter resource constraints, SDK 8.0 delivers a set of innovations that: 
  * Adapt its scanning settings and UI to context by analyzing the scanning environment and user intent;
  * Automate the capture of any data format, barcode clustering, task handling or camera settings;
  * Accelerate critical use cases to maximize ROI through intuitive, streamlined scanning workflows, using interactive AR-guidance, adaptive UI and out-of-the-box custom-branded passenger experiences.

With SDK 8.0 businesses can transform data capture from a basic function to a strategic advantage. It enables intelligent scanning that:
  * Understands not just what is being scanned, but also what you want to scan and why you’re scanning it
  * Adapts accordingly by adjusting scanning settings and/or UI, understanding what comes next and how to guide users seamlessly through sophisticated tasks to ensure the highest level of productivity.

#### Core

* We've fundamentally redesigned our .NET SDK's architecture to better align with the modern .NET ecosystem!
  * **Platform-Agnostic .net8.0 and net9.0 Targets**: The SDK now includes generic net8.0 and .net9.0 targets. This allows you to reference `Scandit.DataCapture.Core` and related packages directly from non-UI projects, such as class libraries or unit test projects. This makes it significantly easier to build modular, testable applications following principles like Clean Architecture.
* **Mandatory SDK Initialization**: Due to the architectural changes, the SDK now requires explicit initialization at application startup. The public API has not changed, but you must add the corresponding initialization code to your application for the SDK to function correctly.

#### ID

* Added `ElementsToRetain` to `MobileDocumentScanner`: The set of data elements that the application intends to retain from scanned mobile documents. This information is used to set the `IntentToRetain` flag in ISO 18013-5 mdoc requests, which is required for legal compliance with data protection standards. An empty set indicates no elements will be retained, and `IntentToRetain` will be set to `false` for all fields.
* ID Capture now supports full-frame anonymization.
* The result of `decodeMobileDriverLicenseViz`, which is currently returned as part of the `VizResult` within `CapturedId`, will now be provided through a new field named `mobileDocumentOcr`.
* Added `CapturedId::isCitizenPassport`, which indicates whether the passport was issued to a citizen of the issuing country. Returns `false` for travel documents such as refugee, stateless, or alien passports, and for any passports issued by organizations rather than states.
* The following Chinese travel permits now extract VIZ + MIZ data during double-sided scanning flows:
  * CT - Taiwan Residents Mainland Travel Permit
  * W - Mainland Residents Exit-Entry Permit to and from Hong Kong and Macao
  * CD - Mainland Residents Entry-Exit Permit to and from Taiwan

### Behavioral Changes

#### Barcode

* Symbology `RM4SCC` has been renamed to `ROYAL_MAIL_4STATE`.
* Changed the default highlight brush in SparkScan and Barcode Capture.

#### ID

* The configuration for the following documents has been changed as detailed below:
  * Australian mobile driver licenses (mDL) are now treated as normal documents, with no separate mode.
  * US Green Cards are now treated as residence permits.
* Removed the deprecated API `DateResult::toDate`. Use `DateResult::toLocalDate` or `DateResult::toUtcDate` instead.
* `fullName` now an optional field on all `IdCapture` result types and `capturedMrz` now an optional field on `MrzResult`.

### Bug Fixes

#### ID

* Fixed a bug that could get the scanner stuck when scanning a US passport card.

### Deprecations

#### Core

* `VideoResolution::Auto` is now deprecated. Please use the capture mode's `recommendedCameraSettings` for the best results.

#### Barcode

* All previously deprecated APIs have been removed in this release.
