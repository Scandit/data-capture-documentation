# Get Started

This page will guide you through the process of adding ID Capture to your Web application. ID Capture is a mode of the Scandit Data Capture SDK that allows you to capture and extract information from personal identification documents, such as driver's licenses, passports, and ID cards.

The general steps are:

- Create a [DataCaptureContext](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/core/api/data-capture-context.html#class-scandit.datacapture.core.DataCaptureContext).
- Access a [Camera](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/core/api/camera.html#class-scandit.datacapture.core.Camera).
- Use [IdCaptureSettings](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/id-capture-settings.html#class-scandit.datacapture.id.IdCaptureSettings) to configure the scan process.
- Implement an [IdCaptureListener](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/id-capture-listener.html#interface-scandit.datacapture.id.IIdCaptureListener) to receive scan results.
- Set up [DataCaptureView](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/core/api/ui/data-capture-view.html#class-scandit.datacapture.core.ui.DataCaptureView) and [IdCaptureOverlay](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/ui/id-capture-overlay.html#class-scandit.datacapture.id.ui.IdCaptureOverlay) to see the camera feed and the scan UI.
- Begin the scanning by adding an [IdCapture](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/id-capture.html#class-scandit.datacapture.id.IdCapture) to [DataCaptureContext](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/core/api/data-capture-context.html#class-scandit.datacapture.core.DataCaptureContext) and starting a camera.

:::warning
Using ID Capture at the same time as other modes (e.g. Barcode Capture) is not supported.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before starting with adding a capture mode, make sure that you have a valid Scandit Data Capture SDK license key and that you added the necessary dependencies. If you have not done that yet, check out [this guide](/sdks/web/add-sdk.md).

:::tip
You can retrieve your Scandit Data Capture SDK license key by signing in to [your Scandit account](https://ssl.scandit.com/dashboard/sign-in).
:::

Please note that your license may support only a subset of ID Capture features. If you would like to use additional features please contact us at [Scandit Support](mailto:support@scandit.com).

### Module Overview

import IdModuleOverview from '../../../partials/get-started/_id-module-overview-no-eu-dl.mdx';

<IdModuleOverview/>

### Configure and Initialize the Library

In addition to the configuration detailed in the [installation guide](/sdks/web/add-sdk.md#configure-the-library), there are some additional steps required for ID Capture.

For ID Capture, the result of [idCaptureLoader()](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/id-capture.html#method-scandit.datacapture.id.IdCaptureLoader) must be passed to the [ConfigureOptions.moduleLoaders](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/core/api/web/configure.html#property-scandit.datacapture.core.IConfigureOptions.ModuleLoaders) option.

In this example, we will scan VIZ documents, so we also need to set [IdCaptureLoaderOptions.enableVIZDocuments](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/id-capture.html#property-scandit.datacapture.id.IIdCaptureLoaderOptions.EnableVIZDocuments) to true:

```ts
import { configure } from '@scandit/web-datacapture-core';
import { idCaptureLoader } from '@scandit/web-datacapture-id';

await configure({
	licenseKey: '-- ENTER YOUR SCANDIT LICENSE KEY HERE --',
	libraryLocation: '/self-hosted-sdc-lib/',
	moduleLoaders: [idCaptureLoader({ enableVIZDocuments: true })],
});
```

:::warning
You must await the returned promise as shown to be able to continue.

## Create the Data Capture Context

The first step to add capture capabilities to your application is to create a new [data capture context](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/core/api/data-capture-context.html#class-scandit.datacapture.core.DataCaptureContext).

```js
import { DataCaptureContext } from "@scandit/web-datacapture-core"

// the license key used in configure() will be used
const context = await DataCaptureContext.create();
```

## Add the Camera

You need to also create the [Camera](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/core/api/camera.html#class-scandit.datacapture.core.Camera 'Camera class'):

```ts
import { Camera } from "@scandit/web-datacapture-core";
import { IdCapture } from "@scandit/web-datacapture-id";


const camera = Camera.default;
await context.setFrameSource(camera);

const cameraSettings = IdCapture.recommendedCameraSettings;

// Depending on the use case further camera settings adjustments can be made here.

await camera.applySettings(cameraSettings);
```

## Create ID Capture Settings

Use [IdCaptureSettings](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/id-capture-settings.html#class-scandit.datacapture.id.IdCaptureSettings) to configure the scanner type to use and the documents that should be accepted and/or rejected.

Check [IdCaptureDocumentType](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/id-capture-document.html#enum-scandit.datacapture.id.IdCaptureDocumentType) for all available options.

```ts
const settings = new IdCaptureSettings();

// Documents from any region:
settings.acceptedDocuments.push(new IdCard(Region.AnyRegion));
// Only documents issued by a specific country:
settings.acceptedDocuments.push(new IdCard(Region.Germany));
// Regional documents:
settings.acceptedDocuments.push(new RegionSpecific.ApecBusinessTravelCard());
// Reject passports from certain regions:
settings.rejectedDocuments.push(new Passport(Region.Cuba));

// To scan only one-sided documents and a given zone:
settings.scannerType = new SingleSideScanner({ barcode: true });
// or
settings.scannerType = new SingleSideScanner({ machineReadableZone: true });
// or
settings.scannerType = new SingleSideScanner({ visualInspectionZone: true });

// To scan both sides of the document:
settings.scannerType = new FullDocumentScanner();
```

Create a new ID Capture mode with the chosen settings:

```ts
const idCapture = IdCapture.forContext(context, settings);
```

## Implement the Listener

To receive scan results, implement [IdCaptureListener](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/id-capture-listener.html#interface-scandit.datacapture.id.IIdCaptureListener). The listener provides two callbacks: `onIdCaptured` and `onIdRejected`.

```ts
idCapture.addListener({
	onIdCaptured: (data) => {
		// Success! Handle extracted data here.
	},
	onIdRejected: (data, reason) => {
		// Something went wrong. Inspect the reason to determine the follow-up action.
	}
});
```

### Handling Success

Capture results are delivered as a [CapturedId](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/captured-id.html#class-scandit.datacapture.id.CapturedId). This class contains data common for all kinds of personal identification documents.

For more specific information, use its non-null result properties (e.g. [CapturedId.barcode](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/captured-id.html#property-scandit.datacapture.id.CapturedId.Barcode)).

On a successful scan you may read the extracted data from `CapturedId`:

```ts
onIdCaptured: (data) => {
	const fullName = data.fullName;
	const dateOfBirth = data.dateOfBirth;
	const dateOfExpiry = data.dateOfExpiry;
	const documentNumber = data.documentNumber;

	// Process data:
	processData(fullName, dateOfBirth, dateOfExpiry, documentNumber);
}
```

:::tip
All data fields are optional, so it's important to verify whether the required information is present if some of the accepted documents may not contain certain data.
:::

### Handling Rejection

The ID scanning process may fail for various reasons. Start from inspecting [RejectionReason](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/rejection-reason.html#enum-scandit.datacapture.id.RejectionReason) to understand the cause.

You may wish to implement the follow-up action based on the reason of failure:

```ts
onIdRejected: (data, reason) => {
	if (reason === RejectionReason.Timeout) {
		// Ask the user to retry, or offer alternative input method.
	} else if (reason === RejectionReason.DocumentExpired) {
		// Ask the user to provide alternative document.
	} else if (reason === RejectionReason.HolderUnderage) {
		// Reject the process.
	}
}
```

## Set up Capture View and Overlay

When using the built-in camera as [frameSource](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/core/api/frame-source.html#interface-scandit.datacapture.core.IFrameSource), you will typically want to display the camera preview on the screen together with UI elements that guide the user through the capturing process.

To do that, add a [DataCaptureView](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/core/api/ui/data-capture-view.html#class-scandit.datacapture.core.ui.DataCaptureView) to your view hierarchy:

```ts
const view = await DataCaptureView.forContext(context);
view.connectToElement(htmlElement);
```

Then create an instance of [IdCaptureOverlay](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/ui/id-capture-overlay.html#class-scandit.datacapture.id.ui.IdCaptureOverlay) attached to the view:

```ts
import { IdCaptureOverlay } from "@scandit/web-datacapture-id";

// ...

let overlay = await IdCaptureOverlay.withIdCaptureForView(
	idCapture,
	dataCaptureView
);
```

The overlay chooses the displayed UI automatically, based on the selected [IdCaptureSettings](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/id-capture-settings.html#class-scandit.datacapture.id.IdCaptureSettings).

If you prefer to show a different UI or to temporarily hide it, set the appropriate [IdCaptureOverlay.idLayout](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/web/id-capture/api/ui/id-capture-overlay.html#property-scandit.datacapture.id.ui.IdCaptureOverlay.IdLayout).

## Start the Capture Process

Finally, turn on the camera to start scanning:

```ts
import { FrameSourceState } from "@scandit/web-datacapture-core";

// ...

await camera.switchToDesiredState(FrameSourceState.On);
```
