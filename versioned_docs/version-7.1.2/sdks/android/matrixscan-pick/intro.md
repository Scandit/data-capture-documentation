# About MatrixScan Pick

MatrixScan Pick is a pre-built UI that uses augmented reality overlays to highlight specific items that need to be picked. Whereas MatrixScan AR is fully customizable, MatrixScan Pick is a pre-built solution that allows you to add a scan and pick experience with augmented reality to an existing native app, with just a few lines of code.

MatrixScan Pick is implemented through functionality provided by [`BarcodePick`](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/android/barcode-capture/api/barcode-pick.html).

## UI Overview

* MatrixScan Pick is inspired by the familiar paradigm of a camera, including a shutter button that the user operates in order start and pause the scanning view. The Finish button is used at any time to exit the workflow.
* It highlights items with obvious and colorful visual dots on screen.
* When paused, MatrixScan Pick freezes the display at the last view, even if the device is moved. The Play button transitions back to the live view.
* Textual guidance is displayed from the beginning of the session and as the workflow progresses, informing of the user of changes in item status (i.e. Detected, Ignored, To-Pick, or Picked).
* Status icons can be defined to provide further information to users for a given barcode. In the live view, the icons are displayed but not tapable. In the frozen view, the status icons can be tapped and expanded to provide additional textual information.
* This guide takes you through the process to install the full UI. However, you can then customize it by choosing to remove any elements on the screen except for the AR overlays. This allows you to create custom UIs suitable for your own workflows.

## Supported Symbologies

MatrixScan Find supports all [symbologies](../../../barcode-symbologies.md) **except** DotCode, MaxiCode and postal codes (KIX, RM4SCC).

If you are not familiar with the symbologies that are relevant for your use case, you can use capture presets that are tailored for different verticals (e.g. retail, logistics, etc.).
