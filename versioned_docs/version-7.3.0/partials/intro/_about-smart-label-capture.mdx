Smart Label Capture enables the simultaneous scanning of multiple barcodes and printed text on labels, streamlining data entry and reducing errors. By combining barcode recognition with OCR and built-in intelligence, it can understand the context of the data and extract only the relevant fields for your application. 

This technology is particularly beneficial in scenarios where labels contain various data points, such as serial numbers, weights, or expiry dates.

## Understanding Labels in Smart Label Capture

The first step to using Smart Label Capture is to define the labels that you want to capture.
A label is a collection of text and barcode fields that are meant to be scanned in one scan process.

To intelligently extract only the fields that are relevant, Smart Label Capture relies on a combination of multiple cues:

* The content of texts or barcodes (e.g. a serial number always having a fixed number of digits)
* The barcode symbology (e.g. QR code, UPC, EAN13, etc.)
* The relative position of fields
* Textual context, i.e. text that is close to the field and describes it's meaning (e.g. "BEST BEFORE" next to an expiry date text)

import LabelCapture from "../../../../src/components/IconComponents/LabelCapture";

Label fields can be defined as optional, so that they are only captured if they are present and readable.

## Applications and Use Cases

While Smart Label Capture is a flexible and customizable solution for label scanning, to make it easier for developers we have designed the API to support a series of common use cases with minimal configuration by using pre-made label blocks.

These use cases have been extensively tested to ensure reliable performance. Some examples of the supported use-cases:

* <strong>Retail Products</strong>
<br/>Streamline in-store order fulfillment by capturing barcodes, expiry dates, prices, net weights and other text automatically.<br/><img src="/img/batch-scanning/SLC-retail.gif" width="400px" alt="Label Capture workflow for scanning smart device labels" />
* <strong>Smart Device Labels with Multiple Barcodes</strong>
<br/>Read UPC, serial numbers, IMEI1 and IMEI2 and other data from smart devices labels, regardless of the design and format of the individual label.<br/><img src="/img/batch-scanning/SLC-smart-devices.gif" width="400px" alt="Label Capture workflow for scanning smart device labels" />
* <strong>And many more...</strong>
<br/>We are constantly expanding our list of supported scenarios. If your specific use case is not currently listed, please reach out to [Scandit Support](mailto:support@scandit.com).
