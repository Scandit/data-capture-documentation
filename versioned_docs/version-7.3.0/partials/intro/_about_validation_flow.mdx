## Validation Flow

Validation Flow is a ready-to-use workflow in Smart Label Capture that streamlines the capture and validation of label data with minimal code. It combines multiple data points, such as expiry dates, lot numbers, weights, and prices, into a single scan.

If any fields are missed or need correction, users can easily review and manually add or fix data, ensuring complete and accurate results without having to rescan the entire label.
