Tote mapping is a feature that allows you to map barcodes to specific totes. This is useful for In-Store Order Fulfillment scenarios where you need to scan a barcode and have the system automatically assign the item to a specific tote.

MatrixScan Count additionally supports the concept of sub-totes. Sub-totes are useful when you have a large tote that contains multiple smaller totes. When you scan a barcode, the system will automatically assign the item to the correct sub-tote.
