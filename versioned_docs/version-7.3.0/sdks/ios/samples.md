Simple sample showing how to use the Barcode Capture mode to scan a single barcode.

### Batch Scanning

#### MatrixScan Batch

Examples utilizing the low-level [`BarcodeBatch`](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/android/barcode-capture/api/barcode-batch.html) API.

##### [Simple Highlight](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/03_Advanced_Batch_Scanning_Samples/01_Batch_Scanning_and_AR_Info_Lookup/MatrixScanSimpleSample)

<ReactPlayer playing controls url="/img/samples/ms-simple.mp4" />

Simple sample showing how to use MatrixScan to highlight barcodes in a frame.

##### [Rejection](https://github.com/Scandit/datacapture-ios-samples/tree/master/03_Advanced_Batch_Scanning_Samples/01_Batch_Scanning_and_AR_Info_Lookup/MatrixScanRejectSample)

<ReactPlayer playing controls url="/img/samples/ms-reject.mp4" />

Use custom conditions to highlight and scan only the barcodes that meet the specified criteria.

#### MatrixScan Count
