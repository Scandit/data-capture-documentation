MatrixScan is powered by the `BarcodeAr` functionality of the Scandit Smart Data Capture SDK. It can be used to add the following customizabe UI elements to your workflows:

## Highlights

Used to enable the user to identify the scanned barcode. They are shown on top of the respective barcode and displayed as soon as the barcode is scanned.

## Annotations

Displayed outside of the area of a barcode and attach to the scanned barcode. There are multiple types of annotations available:

### Info Annotation

Comprised of any desired combination of text and/or icons. Info annotations are displayed on the screen and can be configured to appear on scan.

### Status Icons
