# About Barcode Selection

Barcode Selection enables you to increase scanning accuracy and prevent users from scanning the wrong code in scenario where there are multiple barcodes present. This includes the following:

- A crowded shelf where users want to scan the correct barcode to report stockouts or perform a cycle count.
- An order catalog with barcodes printed closely together.
- A label that has several types of barcodes; however users are only interested in scanning barcodes that have the same type, but cannot select them programmatically.

Barcode Selection provides two key capabilities:

- **Aim to Select** allows users to select one code at a time. This is especially useful for one-handed operation.
- **Tap to Select** is a quick way for users to select several codes from the same view. Selection is done by tapping on highlighted barcodes in the live camera preview or on a frozen screen. Tapping on codes while keeping the smartphone steady can be tricky, and freezing the screen allows for ergonomic use.

:::warning
Barcode Selection does not support handling of duplicate codes. If a code appears twice in the visible preview both instances will be marked as selected even if only one of them was selected.
