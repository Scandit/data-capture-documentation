# About ID Capture

ID Capture provides the capability to scan personal identification documents, such as identity cards, passports or visas, covering everything from checking the age or name on a personâ€™s ID to conducting complex analysis of identity documents to verify if they are real or fake.

Scandit ID Capture software captures data from IDs using a combination of text recognition (optical character recognition/OCR), barcode scanning, and image recognition. This data can be instantly analyzed, on-device, to determine if the ID is authentic.

The scanning and validation results can be used to enable real-time decision making and workflow automation at scale. For example, frontline workers can be given an instant age calculation from the extracted date of birth and/or guidance on whether an ID is real or fake.

ID Capture runs on any smart device with a camera, including smartphones, tablets, and dedicated scanners.

:::tip
In addition to the ID Capture capabilities of the Scandit SDK, Scandit also offers a cloud-based identity scanning solution called [ID Bolt](https://www.scandit.com/products/id-bolt/). ID Bolt can be quickly and easily integrated into any existing web-based application. See the [documentation](../../../hosted/id-bolt/overview) for more information.
